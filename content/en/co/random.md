## Random


The `Random` class is a very fast pseudo-random number generator, which can generate integers between 1 and 2G-2 continuously and without repetition.


### Random::Random


```cpp
Random();
explicit Random(uint32_t seed);
```


- The default constructor uses 1 as the seed number, and the second constructor uses the parameter seed as the seed number.



### Random::next


```cpp
uint32_t next();
```


- Returns the next pseudo-random number, **not thread safe**. Once the seed number is determined, the random sequence generated by calling next() is completely determined.



- Example



```cpp
Random r(7);
int n = r.next();
```
